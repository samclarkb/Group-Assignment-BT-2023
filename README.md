## :bulb: Concept 
The application mainly focuses on enable users to find their favorite hip-hop albums. With the help of filters and a search function the user can look up a variety of hip-hop albums. When the user finds an album he/she seems to like, the user can click on the preview for some additional information about the album. The user is also able to like, delete or upload an ablum.
